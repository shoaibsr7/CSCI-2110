in java all objects are stored in a heap and when we create a "new" object adn the Java Virtual machine cannot allocate
the newly created object since there is no more memory available by the garbage collector.

Garbage collector in java identifies the objects without any references and uses up that space.
In this case due to the huge size the garbage collectors limit is exceeded.
